Cancer is one of the major health concerns for people from all around the world. In each year, cancer causes millions of deaths. Besides, the cost for the treatment is very high. Therefore, early detection of cancer, in terms of cost and accuracy, plays a critical role. The motivation for the project is to reduce the workload of the pathologists to perform manual detection by providing a novel approach on the prediction of different cancer types using whole slide images obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We proposed a stacking ensemble of a target deep learning model on top of a pre-trained DenseNet201 architecture with transfer learning. Our model tends to provide two different outputs including a prediction for tissue classification of SKCM, LUSC and COAD cancer types and the prediction of the age of the patient owning the TCGA tissue sample. The performance of the proposed model is compared with other CNN architectures built on top of the pre-trained VGG16 and ResNet152V2 architectures. After a wide hyperparameter search, it is concluded that DenseNet201 performed the best with having overall accuracy 84.60%.
